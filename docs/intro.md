Sigle is a decentralised and open-source Web 3.0 writing platform made for writers.

We have created Sigle to thwart the big corporate industries that sell your data against your consent to make money on your back.
We are focusing on protecting your privacy. Using a decentralised protocol and running top of Stacks, we will give you the possibility to store and lock your writing literally forever.
