# Migrate to the Hiro web wallet

If you created your account before February 2022, you were used to using "Blockstack Connect" to sign in to your account. Follow this guide to migrate your account to the new Hiro web wallet and continue using Sigle.

## Recover your secret key

The first step is to make sure your secret key is saved before you log out. When you created your account, should have saved your secret key (12 words) somewhere safe.

If it's not the case, you can get the secret key associated with your account at [app.blockstack.org](https://app.blockstack.org/). Click "View Secret Key" on the top right corner and copy the secret key somewhere safe.
