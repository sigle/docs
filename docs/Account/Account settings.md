You can customize your blog by going to the settings page.

Choose a name for your blog, add a description and a profile picture (or logo).
All of these will appear in the header of your blog.
You can also choose a primary color which will be used for the links and dates.

If you leave the name input empty, your Blockstack ID will show up.
