### Upload a cover image

You can upload a cover image to a story in order to display to image you want on social media. This cover image is also used on your Sigle dashboard to present the drafted or published story and as a cover on the story itself.

If you want to add a cover image to your story, first you have to "edit" it.
Now that you're in the editor, click on the settings icon in the top right, next to the "publish" button.
A menu will slide from the right part of your screen.

Don't forget to save!
