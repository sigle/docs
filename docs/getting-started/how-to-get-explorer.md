We‚Äôll guide you through the steps of acquiring your first Explorer Guild NFT, and unlocking its superpowers.

NFTs are magical. The Explorer Guild, even more so. Last year, we created 10,000 NFTs (7,000 of which were burned) and became one of the first startups in the world to use NFTs to raise funds, through an NFT mint.

To place our community even more at the heart of our project, we gave special purpose to our NFTs. Each NFT gives you access to a **Creator + account** on Sigle, which unlocks multiple premium features such as **the analytics page**, an **NFT gating** for your exclusive/paid content, being featured on **the Discover page**, a **personal domain** and more...

Your Explorer Guild NFT will also give you access to a members-only area on our Discord and of course, you can use it as a profile picture on your favorite social networks (including Sigle).

**Let's see now how to get one of these NFTs.**

1. Install the Hiro wallet. The Hiro web wallet extension is an open-source browser extension that acts as a web wallet for the Stacks blockchain. It is available for Chrome, Brave and Firefox. If you don‚Äôt know what it is, you can read more about the Hiro wallet [here](./create-leather-wallet.md).
2. Add some $STX to your wallet. $STX is the crypto-currency used on the Stacks blockchain. If you don‚Äôt know how to get some, you can read more about it [here](./how-to-buy-stx.md).
3. Go to [gamma.io](https://gamma.io/collections/the-explorer-guild) and click on ‚ÄúConnect wallet‚Äù. Your Hiro wallet will open asking you for your password or your 12 keywords. Chose the account you want to connect to (if you just installed the app, you might have only one called ‚Äúaccount 1‚Äù).
4. Choose the Explorer you want and click on ‚Äúbuy now‚Äù or make a collection offer.

6. At times, depending on the congestion of the blockchain, the transaction may take a while to go through. Wait for the transaction to be validated.
7. **Well done!** You just bought your first NFT on Stacks. üéâ

The NFT is now in your wallet. Connect to Sigle using your Hiro wallet and follow the [Step by Step guide on how to activate your Creator + plan using your Explorer Guild NFT!](./unlock-creator-plan.md)
