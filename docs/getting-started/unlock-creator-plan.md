The Creator + plan allows you to access all Sigle premium features thanks to your Explorer Guild NFT. Let’s see how to activate it.

1. First, you need to log in to [app.sigle.io](http://app.sigle.io) using the Hiro Wallet. Log in with your wallet is essential so we can detect you’re in possession of an Explorer Guild (TEG) NFT. Read more if needed on [how to install the Hiro wallet](./create-leather-wallet.md) or [how to get your TEG](./how-to-get-explorer.md)
2. Go to Settings > [Plans](https://app.sigle.io/settings/plans). This page displays your current plan. If this is your first time on this page, you’re probably on the Starter plan.
3. Click the “Upgrade” button. You are now on the “Compare plans” page.
4. Click on the purple “Link your NFT” button, under the Creator + plan. A modal will open.
5. Select the Explorer Guild you want to link to the Creator + plan.
   _Important: Please note that if you decide to list or sell this specific NFT on secondary markets, the Creator + plan will be disabled and you will have to choose another NFT._
6. Congratulations, you just upgraded! Now visit the [Analytics page](https://app.sigle.io/analytics) and enjoy Sigle’s first premium feature.
