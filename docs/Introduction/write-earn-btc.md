# How to monetise your content?

![write and earn BTC](/img/illustrations/illu_3.png)

**_Comming Q2 2022_**

On Sigle, all transactions are done in crypto-currencies. The currency used on Sigle is named "Stacks" (or STX) as we use the Stacks blockchain to secure your work. [Learn more about STX.](https://www.stacks.co/explore/get-stx)

You have **2 monetisation systems** to make profit from your writings:

### Stacking model:

The first monetisation system we offer on Sigle is the most innovative and compelling on the market. Any reader can lock up Stacks tokens to subscribe to a writer. **Locking up STX will generate a yield (in Bitcoin) that will be used to pay the writer.**

By doing this, the readers can subscribe to any writers without spending their principle and get 100% of their funds back when they unsubscribe.

We call this mechanism "Stacking".

### Classic subscription model:

The readers can decide to pay (in STX) the writers every month to get access to their exclusive contents and newsletters.
