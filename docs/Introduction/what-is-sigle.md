# What is Sigle?

![Introduction illustration](/img/illustrations/login.png)

[Sigle](https://www.sigle.io/) is a decentralised and open-source Web 3.0 blogging platform.

We are focusing on giving the power back to the writers and protecting their privacy. Using a decentralised protocol and running on top of the [Stacks blockchain](https://www.stacks.co/), we will give you the possibility to store and lock your writing literally forever.

Users have control over their personal data and what they write on Sigle. You're totally anonymous (at least, if you want to be). We don't control your data and we can't sell it.

Welcome to the new Web3 era.

# Why we created Sigle?

We have created Sigle to thwart the big corporate industries that sell user data against their consent and control their economy by creating algorithms in favor of the platform and not in favor of the user.

Today, centralized platforms and their private algorithms can decide to limit your account at any time and take away your content, community and revenue. Deplatforming and shadow banning are a regular occurrence.

One day to another, a writter account can become limited without justification from the centralised platform. Your funds, content and community will then be locked.

If you're living on your writings, then you become depent of the platform you use.

On Sigle, you own your content, you own your economy, you own your data, you own your community.

**On Sigle, you are your own master.**

# Sigle protocol... in a more technical way

We offer a solution where you truly own your content and community. All your data is stored forever via smart contracts on the blockchain via [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/). This enables any developer to access their content via open APIs.

Switching from one client to another does not mean losing access to your content.

Each client can not only have their own unique content policy, but also their own monetization strategy. **Any developer can leverage our protocol to integrate the latest and greatest Defi (DEcentralised FInance) products.**
