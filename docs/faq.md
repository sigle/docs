## Where is my data stored?

When you write on Sigle, all of your data is stocked on a blockchain hub created by Blockstack called Gaia. Gaia’s approach to decentralization focuses on user control over data and its storage. If you want to learn more about Blockstack and Gaia, we invite you to [follow this link](https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/references/gaia).

## Is Sigle free?

Sigle is totally free, but we are working on a paid version of Sigle (Creator plan) that will bring premium and exclusive features.

Explorer Guild NFTs are a free lifetime access to the upcoming Creator plan. [More info here](https://www.explorerguild.io/)
